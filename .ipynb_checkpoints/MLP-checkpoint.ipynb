    "In this assignment, you will explore and implement the properties of a primary deep learning model called ***multilayer perceptron(MLP)***. Basically, the goal of an MLP is to learn a non-linear mapping from inputs to outputs. We can show this mapping as $y = f(x; \\theta)$ , where $x$ is the input and $\\theta$ is a vector of all the parameters in the network, which we're trying to learn.  \n",

In every Neuron, a dot product between the inputs of the cell and a weight vector is calculated. The result of the dot product then goes through a non-linear function (activation function e.g. $tanh$ or $sigmoid$) and gives us the output of the neuron.\n",
