    "In this assignment, you will explore and implement the properties of a primary deep learning model called ***multilayer perceptron(MLP)***. Basically, the goal of an MLP is to learn a non-linear mapping from inputs to outputs. We can show this mapping as $y = f(x; \\theta)$ , where $x$ is the input and $\\theta$ is a vector of all the parameters in the network, which we're trying to learn.  \n",

    "As you see in the figure, every MLP network consists of an input layer, an output layer, and one or more hidden layers in between. Each layer consists of one or more cells called Neurons. In every Neuron, a dot product between the inputs of the cell and a weight vector is calculated. The result of the dot product then goes through a non-linear function (activation function e.g. $tanh$ or $sigmoid$) and gives us the output of the neuron.\n",
